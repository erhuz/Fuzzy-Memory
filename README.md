# Fuzzy Memory
The assignment is to create a memory game entirely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game should be completed before December 4 2018 09:00 and pushed to an public repository on GitHub.

## **OBS!**
_I used SCSS in this assignment, but I refered from using the built in SCSS functions, therefore I do not count this as cheating. **I only used SCSS due to its nesting functionality.**_
